### Lesson 1

#### High/Low context communication 高/低语境沟通
##### A. low context communication
表达直接，精确，高效，一般有什么说什么不多客气那一种。
一般北美、西欧属于这种低语境文化。
##### B. High context communication
表达不直接，描述性语言较多，且邮件比较长。也就是邮件比较官方且正式。
一般中东、亚洲、非洲、南美洲属于这种低语境文化。
##### C. Conclusion
所以在给不同文化语境的人发邮件时，应该先预先判断对方的语境，再选择说话方式。
比如发给韩国人一封邮件讨论工作，第一段先寒暄，也就是嘘寒问暖。
第二段进入主题，但是要比较委婉用一些客气的句式。最后表示感谢。

### lesson 2
#### Age & Gender considerations 对年纪和性别的考虑
1. 使用敬语。如先生，女士，夫人，或者使用title。
2. 不要使用读起来会让不同性别的收件人误会的句子。比如潜在的性别歧视和年龄优势。

### Last assignment

Dear Me,

How are you? After several week's learning, I think you must have a lot of gains. Here I would like to do a summary to end this learning trip.

I come from China and my native language is chinese. Since my country is in the Asia, so my culture's communication style is high context communication, which means you should be polite and formal when you write to people in China.

I think the most important three things when writing a professional email are people's title, subject line and the tone of text. First, the title, which means how we call people. It is very important to know people's gender and title, otherwise they will consider you unprofessional. Second, the subject line should be short and precise. Because people in a company will receive hundreds of emails, they will ignore your email if your subject line is not clear or it looks like a spam. Third, the tone, which is significant because people in our country will judge your professional by whether your tone is formal and polite or not.

After learning this course, I think the best advice is choosing different writing style according to people's culture background. And I will apply this into my writing. Thank this course and also thank myself for my time and effort.

Best regards,

Huaijian
