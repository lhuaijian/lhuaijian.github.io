### Lesson 1
#### 介绍邮件 - 介绍两个人见面或者认识
Poor example: Meet Sam Boyle
Better example: Meet Sam Boyle, CPA Tax Specialist or Introducing Sam Boyle, CPA Tax Specialist

要注意写清楚介绍的原因。

介绍自己时，可以用以下句式：
- I am especially skilled at ... (using Microsoft Office, coding keras to complete CNN neural network.)
- My skills include ... (using Microsoft Office, coding keras to complete CNN neural network.)

#### 公告电子邮件 - 告诉其他专业人士新东西的方式

发送前，一定要double check并检查是否涵盖了所有的方面以及需要回答的问题。

### lesson 2
#### 写介绍邮件和公告电子邮件的关键词
##### A.介绍邮件
Email text four parts:
- introduction sentence 
- controlling idea
- development 
- conclusion 

关于介绍自己的邮件：
- 第一句写自己的名字，职位，单位。
- 第二句写为什么要把自己介绍给对方。
- 第三句第四句展开说自己想了解的信息。如: I'd like to know more information about ...

关于介绍两人认识的邮件：
- subject line: A, meet B. B, meet A. or A, have you meet B? or Get to know B.
- controlling idea: A, I would like to introduce you to B. B, this is A. He is the person I told you about in our last meeting.
- 然后在展开部分写他们的背景，从哪里毕业，有什么经历，现在在哪里工作，职位是什么等等，然后附上他们的联系信息。如果想让他们自己联系，就只需联系信息就好了。

##### B.公告邮件
语言应该更大胆和直接，类似于广告。
- 第一句写基本信息。Introduction sentence: XXX is pleased to inform you that we ...
- 第二句第三句写更详细的信息。special information or guild.
- 使用简单的感谢结尾。

#### A. introduction
Dear [first name],

My name is [your name], and I’m a [job title] who works in [your location]. I’m reaching out because [reason why you want to speak with this person]. I’d love to learn more about [two or three things you’d like to learn from the person].

I’m sure you’re busy, so even 20 minutes would be appreciated.

##### An example
Dear Monica,

My name is Aja Frost, and I’m a college student who’s interning in the city until mid-August. Your career path is very inspirational to me: I don’t know very many people who have worked in marketing at Google, Facebook, and Apple. As an aspiring marketer, I’d love to learn more about which skills you’ve used the most and what you’d expect from an entry-level employee in your department.

I’m sure you’re busy, so even 20 minutes would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Aja

#### B. announcement
500px
Subject line: Boo! Enjoy this Halloween treat

Most 500px users are familiar with “Plus” and “Awesome” accounts. They are mentioned frequently in emails and calls to action to upgrade are all over the site. So when an email shows up offering a discount, there is a foundation of knowledge in place.

The important parts of this promotional email – “15% off” and “Upgrade Now” – contrast nicely with the white background. Users will know exactly what to do.
